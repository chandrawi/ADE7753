# ADE7753 Arduino Library

ADE7753 is an IC designed for energy measurement and power monitoring applications of single phase AC line.  This library is intended for measuring active, reactive, and apparent energy, sampled waveform, and current and voltage RMS using ADE7753. This library works by interfacing SPI port, frequency counter pin, and interrupt pin with host controller.
